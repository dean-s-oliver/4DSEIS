  description: Proposes a methodology for determining the suitability of a computer model before calibration, targeted at real data assimilation problems with large numbers of model parameters, large amounts of data and correlated observation errors. The model diagnostic is based on an approximation of the Mahalanobis distance suitable for use in high-dimensional spaces.

  description:
    We apply Bayesian Model Probability and Bayesian Averaging to take into account prior scenarios in history matching and uncertainty analysis.  The methodology is used to condition a dynamic reservoir simulation model to frequent 4D seismic data by tuning the top reservoir surface given alternative prior interpretations.
